# Proforge3_Klipper
Klipper for Makertech3Dâ€˜s Proforge 3 printer

If you want to install Klipper on your Proforge I advise you to follow this tutorial first and then come back for the config file.

The config assumes you have wired the printer EXACTLY how it's done in the manual.

Currently implemented upgrades:
-Mic-6 bed
-Octoprint (needed anyways for Klipper)

To do:
-add DSH config (as soon as someone with a DSH is willing to share a config)
-add Enclosure Upgrade (as soon as the manual online)
-add config for the 24V bed
